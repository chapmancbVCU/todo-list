# todo-list
This is my implementation of a robust Todo List App, built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and webpack. Our goal was to create a user-friendly and responsive application that supports all CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) operations for managing tasks. To ensure a seamless user experience, we utilized local storage of the user's web browser, which allows users to save their tasks between browser sessions. 

The Todo List App is intuitive and easy to use, with a simple and clean user interface that allows users to quickly add, edit, delete, and mark their tasks as complete. Additionally, the application is designed to be responsive, ensuring that it is accessible and functional across a range of devices and screen sizes.
